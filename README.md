# AI-Projects

Welcome to the **ai-ml-labs** repository! This collection houses various AI-related subprojects, each focusing on a different aspect of artificial intelligence. Below you'll find an overview of each subfolder and its purpose.

## List of Directories

### LLM (Large Language Models)
This directory contains notes and projects related to large language models. 

### Computer Vision
In this directory, you'll find projects and implementations related to computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
In this directory you can find experiments and implementations that combine retrieval-based methods with generative models. This includes projects that enhance the generative capabilities of models by retrieving relevant information from external sources to improve output quality and relevance.

### Python
This directory contains Python-related projects and code. It includes scripts, libraries, and frameworks tailored for AI and machine learning tasks written in Python

### MLOps
This directory houses everything related to the operational aspects of machine learning, including model deployment, monitoring, automation, and integration of ML models into production environments. You'll find tools and practices aimed at streamlining the deployment of AI models at scale.
