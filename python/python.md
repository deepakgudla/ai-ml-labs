# Python

* created by Guido van Rossum in the year 1991
* named after a sitcom - Monty python flying circus
* Top down approach
* Python is considered as an interpreted language

## variables

- variables are the containers for storing the data values
- with `variables`, we can refer and manipulate the values
- `literals` are values used in python
    - some of the types of literals: numeric, boolean, string etc..

```
a = 1
b = 3
c = a + b
print ("the value of c is", c) 
```
- a - name of the variable name <br>
= - assignment operator <br>
1 - value of a that has been assigned (`literal`)

- rules of creating variables
    - var name should start with letter or an underscore
        - eg:  `a = 1`, or `_a = 3`
    - var name can be alphanumeric
    - var names are case sensitive
        - `a = 1` is different from `A = 1`
    - var name should not be a keyword 

- operators in py
    - arithmetic operator
        - +, -, *, /, %, **
    - comparison operator
        - <, >, =, <=, >=, ==, !=
    - assignment operator
        - helps in assigning a value to a var <br> 
        - +=, -=, /=
    - logical operator
    - bitwise operator
        - & - and gate
    - identity operator <br> 
        `is` and `is not` <br> 
        `a is 1` returns true
    - membership operator <br> 
        `in` and `not in`

## collections in python

- python list
- python tuples
- python dictionary
- pthon sets
- python strings
    - concatenation
        ```
        p = "pyt"
        q = "hon"
        print(p+q)
        ```
    - repetition
         ```
        r = python
        print(r*2) -> python 
        ```
    - membership operators
    - length
    - indexing
    - slicing
